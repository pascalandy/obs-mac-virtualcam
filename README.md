# OBS (macOS) Virtual Camera ðŸŽ¥

![Release](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

Creates a virtual webcam device from the output of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). Especially useful for streaming smooth, composited video into Zoom, Hangouts, Jitsi etc. Like [CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam) but for macOS.

This code was spun out of [this OBS Project RFC](https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/15) which was itself spun out of [this issue](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2568) from [@tobi](https://github.com/tobi). The goal is for this (or something with equivalent functionality) to eventually be merged into the core OBS codebase ðŸ¤ž.

## Donating ðŸ’¸

Consider sending some money in the direction of the [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/contribute) via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/obsproject/contribute), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/OBSProject), or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/obsproject). Obviously, without OBS, this plugin would not be very useful! Hugh "Jim" Bailey is OBS Project's full-time lead developer and project maintainer. This money helps him continue to work on OBS!

If, after you donate to the OBS Project, you also want to send some cash my way that's appreciated too! Feel free to [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/johnboiles) or [PayPal me](paypal.me/johnboiles).

## Known Issues

* The virtual camera doesn't work with all programs due to a combination of [application restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc) and OS restrictions (for built-in apps like Facetime). Check out [COMPATIBILITY.md](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md) to see if your app is supported. Please [edit that file](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/edit/master/COMPATIBILITY.md) and submit a Pull Request if you try other software that we should include in that list.
* OBS needs to be restarted after changing resolutions for the Virtual Camera to work. (#83)

## Installing

* Download and install the latest version of OBS from the [official website](https://obsproject.com).
* Download the latest `.pkg` installer on the [Releases page](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/releases)
* Run the `.pkg` installer (entering your password when required)
* If you're already running OBS, make sure to restart it.
* Restart any app that was running during the installation process that is supposed to pick up the camera.
* To start the virtual camera, go (in OBS) to ` Menu bar` â†’ `Tools` â†’ `Start Virtual Camera`.

Your OBS video should now show up in the target app!
